## Today's theme: Glossaries and Terms

Today weâ€™ll be looking at a draft glossary of terms being created across the DARE sprint projects, and ensuring it represents a shared understanding of what we mean by different terms within the TRE space.

### Notes

### Wrap up & feedback notes
- Where should this document live?
    - Convert the word doc with a website, where everything can be cross-linked etc.
    - Get general agreement from across TRE community that terms make sense
    - Have it as a living document that can be versioned by e.g. GitHub
    - Don't overcomplicate the ontology. Some are so interconnected that they're not really usable anymore, and too difficult to navigate. Don't go too far in that direction, still needs to be something that everyone can use/contribute to.
