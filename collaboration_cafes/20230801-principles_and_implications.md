# Collab Café: Principles and Implications for the specification

**When?**
1st August 2023, 15:00 - 16:00 Europe/London ([see in your time zone](https://arewemeetingyet.com/London/2023-08-01/15:00))

**What?**
_[SATRE (Standardised Architecture for Trusted Research Environments)](https://medium.com/satre) is a DARE UK Driver Project working to standardise access to secure data in trusted research environments. It includes University of Dundee, Alan Turing Institute, UCL, Ulster University, Research Data Scotland._.
[Collaboration Cafes](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/coworking/coworking-collabcafe.html) are **online collaboration and coworking calls** for anyone interested in learning about, discussing and contributing to the project.

**Who?**
_Anyone_ interested in our project & the TRE space is welcome to join this call. No prior sign-ups needed!

**_All questions, comments, and recommendations are welcome!_**

## Today's theme: Principles and Implications for the specification

Accompanying the requirements of the specification are a set of governing principles that any TRE following the SATRE specification should follow, and implications of these principles. This currently includes principles on:

- Usability
- Maintaining trust
- Observability
- Standardisation

In this Collaboration Café, we’ll be discussing and iterating, these principles, including:
• Discussing the thinking behind having principles for the specification
• Reviewing our draft principles
• Discussing whether there are any key principles missing that we should include

## Breakout rooms: Topic proposals and notes

_While no sign-ups are required to attend Collaboration Cafe, if you have an idea for a topic you'd like to discuss in a breakout room, please add it below and put your name next to it. A good place to start to find discussion topics are on the [SATRE Specification GitHub Repository Issue Board](https://github.com/sa-tre/satre-specification/issues)._

[Google doc for today (exported with comments to PDF)](20230801-google_doc_suggestions_satre_principles.pdf)

- Main room: Intro to the project
- Room 1: Usability
- Room 2: Maintaining trust
- Room 3: Observability
- Room 4: Standardisation
- ~~Room 5: New ideas~~ (we will discuss this together later if time)

Possible questions for today:

- A general intro to the project (stay on the main room)
- Further developing the specification capabilities framework

### Wrap up

- **Usability**: the specification needs to eat its own dog food, need to characterise and attend to technical users. and lots of notes in the Gdoc - Users are not only researchers
- **Maintaining trust**: Philosophical and lovely. Public good is important when evaluating access to data and how access is granted. Making the principle broader. Transparency including infrastructure of TREs (and its processes). What happens when something goes wrong, or even when it nearly goes wrong
- **Observability**: is it different from monitoring, is it useful beyond TRE operators and how it would be interesting to other personas. Deeply tied to Trust, but also duty of care for researchers. When does observation and monitoring become surveillance of users? What about their data. Pull out different personas and work on user stories and what being observable/observed would mean
- **Standarisation**: federation and interoperability, a good principle would be _not_ to do things that prevent better solutions in the future (don't be too restrictive). Incorporate and reuse as many current standards as possible. Maintain buy-in on the usefulness/necessity of TREs for which education and marketing are very important; talk about usefulness for research, ROI...
