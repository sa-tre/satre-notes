## How to contribute to the project

Please read a walkthrough of the project and how to contribute: [Walkthrough Doc on GitHub](https://github.com/sa-tre/satre-specification/blob/main/docs/Walkthrough.md) or [Google Doc Version](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zAWxubPWxukDN8WKIXe89uhJitSaicp5/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=105089893876648516018&rtpof=true&sd=true)

## Today's theme: User experience of the specification

- Intro:
  - User testing session - might be a bit uncomfortable
  - One volunteer to share their screen
  - Moderator is just observing unless specific questions are asked
  - Let the moderator know when you think you are done with the task
  - Are we okay to record?
  - If we finish early, come back to the main room

## Breakout rooms: Topic proposals and notes

_While no sign-ups are required to attend Collaboration Cafe, if you have an idea for a topic you'd like to discuss in a breakout room, please add it below and put your name next to it. A good place to start to find discussion topics are on the [SATRE Specification GitHub Repository Issue Board](https://github.com/sa-tre/satre-specification/issues)._

- Main room: Intro to the project
- Breakouts:
  - **Today's Theme:** User experience of the specification

### Notes

#### Breakout room 1

- Scenario: TRE lead
  - You have heard about the SATRE specification and you want to determine whether or not it is relevant to your organisation.

#### Room notes

- Is spec still relevant when SDE is part of a wider network of SDEs? (yes)
- Spec meant to encompass non-health data as well as health data
- Where do we start?
- Assume that IG is covered (by other group, and hypothetically that it has been agreed by overall authority) and let's go from what it is that the SDE needs to do technically
- Is there a good single overview page as a starting point before getting into detail?
- Possibly pillars is the best place to start for somebody unfamiliar
- Feel like we'd have to read everything to decide if it's relevant - maybe need something that gives a high-level view to make a quick decision
- Sector specific section on how SATRE helps
- How would you check whether something like this would help to adopt/support implementation of a particular standard (e.g. ISO/DSPT)? How could you express where the alignment is?
- Having some major institutions evaluate the spec beforehand to say "yes, this is something we would use" would help give confidence that this is something _you_ (i.e. a TRE lead) would want to use
- Agrees with above, essentially
- Suggests different levels of TRE (e.g. bronze, silver, gold)
- Depends on sensitivity of the data, are their different recommendations about what is mandatory, recommended etc for different categories of data
- Why are items ordered this way? What if we put Mandatory items first to make it easier to quickly assess
- Would another angle be a check that would refer to a reference implementation that would show the actual kinds of tools and products you could use to satisty these requirements
- Unfortunately I missed some of this - was asking about specific services, perhaps showing which specific services are used to implement some parts
- Is there a catalogue of specific techs/services that (e.g. like what identity providers) have been used to fulfil particular purposes
-

#### Breakout room 2

- Scenario: TRE operator
  - You have been tasked with making your TRE compliant with the SATRE specification.

#### Room notes

5 attendees

- Interested in the evaluation in the first instance. Then goes to the Evaluation details
- Why I choose this - we have some research environments, now I want to make sure we're compatible - and - compliant
- The initial screen in the specification is heavy - it's a level of complexity that is high
- What does the spreadsheet look like - might be nice to show this and describe it to help user decide whether to download it right now
- Is there an estimate of how much time this would take? In the FAQs we might add a time evaluation of how long it takes for a TRE
- Is there something about roles needed- who has the background and knowledge needed to do an evaluation for instance?
  - Also, it doesn't explicitly say what an operator/builder is
- Perhaps one output based on learnings from today could be an "How to use this specification" section including example "persona journeys"
- Where does it say what I gain from being SATRE compliant - e.g. helps being compatible with other infrastructures - this is implied by How and Why SATRE was developed
  - e.g. why should I invest this time
- Is there a _section, or question, that answers which specific laws and regulations the specification meets_? for IG and members of the public
  - _Can specific examples of regs and specs_ be clearly shown?
  - The 145 statements, or clauses in the specification are quite good. I presented them internally and people got a bit scared looking at them but when you work in this area I think they look quite logical and doable
  - Is it clear from the specs how you might contribute or feed back
    - Attending for the first time, it seems like the specs are done and you're just looking for feedback
    - No, I don't think so, and people who don't use GitHub would be quite insecure about it i think
    - We get to the collab caf√© and the amendments screen, but that takes a little while
    - _It might be worth adding to the FAQs_ a question like
      - "Are the Specs set in stone or can they be changed, and how?"
        - Some this is under the _new contributors_ tab - maybe this might better read something like: how I can contribute
        - The comment form is also very small - designed for folks who don't want to use GitHub, but not obvious
  - Typo on "how do I build and run a SATRE compliant TRE?"
  - Would there need to be a justification to change part of the specification though? if someone suggests a change, maybe they should express a gap the change fills, for example
- Encourage contribution more strongly
- _Explain purpose_ more clearly at start
- Make it easier to navigate to the homepage

#### Breakout room 3

- Scenario: Information governance
  - You have been tasked at evaluating how the SATRE specification aligns with your existing processes, policies, definitions and documentation

#### People

6 attendees

#### Room notes

- Where to look first? What is the specification? That is up front
- Let's look at the IG section (spec 1.).
- Data management might also be relevant.
- The figure relates to the spec sections. Why is the supporting one a different colour? Because it is supporting, not a 'real pillar'
- Name pillars was recognised
- What are the blue boxes in the pillars? They relate to the subsections. Would be nice if that was interactive (navigate the spec using the diagram- i.e. HTML image map, and also include the `1.1` etc in the diagram blue box)
- So what is 1.1.?
- It is mandatory, suppose this means some things are not mandatory
- What are the levels?
  - We see mandatory, recommended optional.
  - What do they mean? (the definitions are not immediately obvious or easy to find)
  - Recognised order of importance
  - Are 3.x titles taken from ISO?
    - Yes, or inspired by ISO
    - See how ISO items may be too vague for TREs, items here are too specific for ISO
    - Understanding the overlap between SATRE and ISO would be really helpful. If you have one, do you have the other? How much?
- Items from 3. I would say are part of IG (or at least impact IG, need to be considered)
- This is more like DSPT than ISO, specific things you need to do rather than guidance
- Points to say if you have 1. ISO 2. DSPT ... here are the items you already meet.
- My org needs ISO. Can I say, I have ISO so I don't need this
  - Is this a guide to implementing ISO (for TREs?)
- I would want to put this into excel to work through
- How do I score this?
  - Went to FAQs (mandatory, recommended... are on overview. Scoring system is on evaluation page)
  - Maybe it depends on your risk appetite
  - Assume must meet all mandatory and nothing else
  - Found definitions on Overview, specification page
  - "We believe" sounds more opinionated that I would like
  - Found evaluation page eventually
    - It has a maturity scale
    - I would put this up higher +1 from Will
    - Spreadsheet! Make this more visible +1
  - Sufficient and satisfied
    - I quite like that. A sense of maturity, identifies where to improve
    - Hmmm. It is subjective though, based on your own awareness. Nudge to a better world.
  - I would work through the spreadsheet methodically. Try to map this to existing documents, policies, SOPs, accreditations...
    - Often find SOPs, controls map to multiple requirements or partially meet requirements. Need to write the difference.
  - There is extra guidance on the site which is not on the spreadsheet
    - Extra text, but it would be helpful +2. Fewer documents to juggle
  - As IG lead, I would delegate some of these items.
    - Often best to work synchronously as a group to avoid responsibility being passed around
- Found examples, could be useful
  - There is a capability met item under each 'thing'
  - There are more things here, what are they?
  - Missing numbers for capabilities on Turing evaluationüòâ
  - component numbers are there, but we can't remember what they mean
  - As a general rule, always use `x.y` or `x.y.z` when referencing statements anywhere in spec
  - Is this useful?
    - I would find this very helpful. Might fork it.
    - Could encourage people to be lazy. May be a benefit to asking people to do this from scratch
    - I would keep this is. An example of a good response shows the level of detail expected. Encourages people to write good responses. Even if you want to copy, this is a good place to start.
- Approach would be download xls, go into a room, and work through it
- How many items are there total?
  - 144 on spreadsheet
  - This isn't a quick, half hour task. Should take days
- I might think, it is hard enough maintaining ISO and DSPT. Why would I go the extra mile to implement this?
  - Data providers unlikely to ask for this
  - Maybe they will in the future?
    - (In background formatting mandatory/optional/recommended cells by colour)
- How many mandatory
  - ~75
  - One "Required"?
- Is it clear from the statements what they want?
  - e.g. "You must understand the risk appetite..."
  - This helps meet the different needs. E.g. if you don't handle medical data you may require less strict controls
  - Pro tiering of controls to meet risk. Not present here, would like to see that in the future.
    - Acknowledged that SATRE has limited funding/time
  - Does anything here nod towards that?
    - Thought maybe recommended implies this is "needed" for higher tiers
  - It does look the recommended items are more specific. Mandatory are more like ISO, a bit vague, leaves decisions up to you, your risk appetite.
    - Accounting for tiers here. Mandatory statements give scope to adjust controls to be proportionate (interesting as we _did_ aim to cover different shapes of TRE)
      - E.g. Egress: Leaving the mandatory statement as slightly vague means you can have different policies for different data tiers
    - Particularly for TREs with very sensitive data it would be good to have stricter requirements, more mandatory.
- Looking at hours/days of work but I think it would be useful
- This does seem to be giving the information we need to undertake this
- Need to give it a real try to find our for certain
